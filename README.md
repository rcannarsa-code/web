This is my journey into learning web development
I've started with a tutorial on HTML to get the basic structure on which to build a website, then passed to CSS to get a fuller understanding of how the graphic aspect of a website works, and lastly I'm studying PHP because is so widely used I believe it's necessary for a more complete knowledge.
